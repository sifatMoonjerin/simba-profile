            <p>
                You might have seen me jumping, climbing trees and ruling the animals. But being a king is boring. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web King.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
